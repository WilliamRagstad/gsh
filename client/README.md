## Usage

Connect to a server application using its IP address or hostname and the port number (default is `1122`):

```bash
gsh 127.0.0.1
```

A window will open, displaying any graphical interface presented by the server application.\
You can interact with the server application through this window, and any user input will be sent to the server for processing.

You can also use the `--insecure` flag to disable TLS certificate **verification** for testing purposes.

```bash
gsh localhost --insecure
```

> TLS certificate might not be valid when connecting **via IP address** due to certificates usually are issued for wildcard/fully qualified (common) **domain names**. - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1119269)

See all available options by running:

```bash
gsh --help
```
