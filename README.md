## What is **Graphical Shell**?

It is a versatile framework designed to empower developers and enthusiasts to create custom graphical server interfaces, applications, services and experiences.
Whether you're building a personal server, a graphical Bulletin Board System (BBS), or exploring new interactive experiences, Graphical Shell provides the tools to bring your ideas to life.

It shippes with a SSH-like client application (`gsh`) that allows users to connect to a server and interact with it through a graphical interface.
All rendering and graphical elements are handled by the server, while the client seamlessly streams user interactions and input to the server for processing.

> ## [Client Application](client/README.md)
>
> The client application is a cross-platform native window that interfaces with graphical server applications in a seamless and intuitive manner.
>
> See latest release binaries for `Linux`, `MacOS`, and `Windows` in the [releases](https://github.com/WilliamRagstad/gsh/releases).

## Features

- **Interactivity**: Integrates graphical elements, allowing users interact with server applications and services.

- **Customizable**: Developers can create their own server applications using the provided library, enabling tailored experiences for specific use cases.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Client application on Linux, macOS, and Windows, ensuring a consistent experience across different operating systems.

- **Security**: TLS 1.3 encryption ensures secure communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive data and user interactions.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development of **gsh**, follow these steps:

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) version 17
  - In the "Workloads" tab enable "Desktop development with C++"
  - Click Modify at the bottom right
- Install [`protoc`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/) version 30.2 *(`shared` dependency)*
- Install [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.31.7 *(`sdl2` dependency)*
- Clone this repository and `cd gsh`

Manual system test for the `colors` example:

1. In `examples/colors/`: `cargo run -q`
2. In `client/`: `cargo run -q -- localhost --insecure`
